    "# Introduction to RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 What is RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "**RAG** is a hybrid approach that combines information retrieval techniques with generative language models to produce more accurate and contextually relevant outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components of RAG:\n",
    "- **Retrieval Component**: Retrieves relevant documents or data from a corpus based on a query.\n",
    "- **Generative Component**: Uses the retrieved information to generate a coherent response.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why RAG?\n",
    "- **Handling Confidential Information**: Unlike traditional LLMs, which are trained on a fixed dataset and struggle with tasks requiring confidential or private data, RAG can retrieve and use sensitive information from secure databases to generate context-aware responses without compromising privacy.\n",
    "- **Adaptability to Dynamic Data**: RAG systems can access and incorporate constantly changing data, such as financial statements or credit ratings, into the generation process. This allows for real-time assessments and decisions based on the most up-to-date information.\n",
    "- **Cost-Effective Updates**: Retraining an LLM regularly to keep it updated is costly and resource-intensive. RAG bypasses this issue by retrieving the latest data directly from a knowledge base, making it more practical and economical for long-term use.\n",
    "- **Personalized Responses**: RAG is well-suited for tasks that are specific to individuals, such as explaining how a person's current number of vacation days has been accrued, by retrieving personalized data and generating tailored responses accordingly.\n",
    "- **Accuracy**: RAG helps mitigate hallucinations (fabricated information) by anchoring outputs to real data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 How RAG Works\n",
    "\n",
    "### RAG Architecture\n",
    "<img src=\"images\\rag.png\" width=\"900\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Typical Workflow:\n",
    "1. **Input Query**: User input or query is processed.\n",
    "2. **Document Retrieval**: The retrieval system searches the database for the most relevant documents.\n",
    "3. **Data Processing**: The retrieved documents are passed to the generative model.\n",
    "4. **Response Generation**: The generative model creates a response based on the retrieved documents.\n",
    "5. **Output**: The system outputs a response that is both informative and contextually accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components of RAG: \n",
    "- **Indexer/Retriever**: Uses vector search or traditional search methods to index all the documents and retrieve the most relevant.\n",
    "- **Generator**: A large language model (LLM) like GPT-3 or similar, which generates a response using the retrieved data.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Limitations of RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "When building RAG systems, there are significant challenges you may encounter in all the three steps previously explained, such as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Indexing**: The effectiveness of RAG is heavily affected by the quality of the data. If the external data source is more noisy than informative, the responses generated by the LLM will not be useful.\n",
    "- **Retrieval**: Depending on your file types and how you’ve set up your RAG system, the system doesn’t always retrieve chunks that help answer user queries.\n",
    "- **Generation**: Even if the RAG system is set up effectively, the LLM can still generate incorrect answers based on imagined facts."
